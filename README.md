# Build Your Personal Portfolio Site

Time to show off. For tonight's assignment you will begin a personal portfolio site.

We're not expecting you to finish your portfolio site tonight, but we'd like you to have a good idea of what you want the site to look like (wireframes are a great place to start) and build something that you will be able to continually improve over the course of WDI. By the end of the course you should have something ready to show employers!

### What to include

1. A short blurb about yourself - you're a web developer now, but what else are you? What makes you unique?

2. A photo of yourself... if you want. We believe a photo helps you stand out and makes it easier for people to remember you.

3. A section for web dev projects - each project should have an image of the project, a short description about what it does and what technologies it uses, and a link to the actual project. Do this even if you only have one project or if you're not super ok with making this project publicly available - you'll constantly be updating this portfolio with new projects and tricks, so this will just serve as a backbone for later.

4. Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, other professional websites you may want linked.

5. Responsiveness! It should look decent on your phone and on the web. Consider putting the below line of code into the HTML head. What do you think it does? `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

### Steps

1. Start by taking some time to think about how you want your portfolio to look. Look around on the web for ideas. Sketch some wireframes!

2. Start building the site! For now, you just need a front-end site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future you can turn your portfolio into a full-stack application that you can deploy to Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.

3. Make your website look awesome. Here's your chance to hone your CSS skills. Feel free to play with animations, transitions, etc. Just don't get too crazy, this is a view into your professional life.

### Deliverable

This will be an ongoing project, but **make sure you have something to show by tomorrow morning**.
